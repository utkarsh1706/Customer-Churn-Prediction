# Customer-Churn-Prediction

##Overview
Customer Churn Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a specific user will leave a service or not. The project involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, optimization using RandomizedSearchCV, and deployment of a Streamlit web application for user interaction.

##Features
- Trained machine learning model for customer churn prediction.
- Streamlit web application for user-friendly interaction with the model.
- Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
- Optimization of the model parameters using RandomizedSearchCV.
